# Image-Color

The goal of this project is to take a directory of images and convert it to a final image with the average color of each image in the directory.
Using the Pillow pyhton library each color value of each pixel of the images in the directory is averaged. These Values are stored and are used to draw a final image with equal width rectangles for the full width of the final image.

Here is an example of the output of the program:
