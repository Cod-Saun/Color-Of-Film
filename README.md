# Color of Film

The goal of this project is to take a directory of images and convert it to a final image with the average color of each image in the directory.
Using the Pillow pyhton library each color value of each pixel of the images in the directory is averaged. These values are stored and are used to draw a final image with equal width rectangles for the full width of the final image.

I created the project after seeing similar graphics posted online corresponding to the overall colors of movies. After seeing the posts I wanted to see if it was something that I could implement myself.

Below are some examples of the output of the program.
